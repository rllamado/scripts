# scripts

A collection of scripts for random uses.
Developed/tested on a Late 2011 Macbook Pro.

# window
Moves the terminal window into corners of the screen. Handles 9
basic positions (top, bottom, left, right, and any combo).

# nbits
Prints the number of bits required for a given number. Prints 
decimal, binary and hex forms of the number. 
BUG (8/22/16): Does not handle negative numbers.

# runqt

of having to navigate through project directory.
